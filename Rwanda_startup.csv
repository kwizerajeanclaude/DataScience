It is registered in Rwanda Development Board (RDB ) as an economic operator under the code 100 005 973 . The bank is relatively new, since it only has 13 years of existence. Established only in Kigali on its debut, the Bank initially setup its headquarters inside Telecom House in Kacyiru district. Later moving their headquarters and main branch, to a new building called Centenary House located in the center of the capital in 2004. The Bank’s rapid growth and popularity soon rendered their premises too small. At the end of 2004, the Bank had already opened five branches; Central Branch (relocated from Kacyiru), Roundabout Branch (opened in 2000), Nyabugogo Branch (opened in 2002), Remera Branch and Kicukiro Branch (opened in 2004). During 2005 and 2006, the Bank further accelerated the development of its network in Kigali, by opening Nyarutarama Branch (in 2005), but most importantly in provinces, where it established branches in main cities of old provinces or main roads. Thus the establishment in Musanze (2005), Huye (in 2005), Nyamagabe (in 2005), Rubavu (in 2006), Rwamagana (in 2006) and Kamembe (in 2006). With 11 outlets, the Bank for three years then consolidated its new locations, before settling on other places, Muhanga (2009), Kabarondo (in 2009) and Tyazo (in 2011). The Bank now has 15 outlets, in many different places, both suburban areas in Kigali as well as provincial cities, thus ensuring the bank has the potential to strengthen its future. Please note that during the year 2012, the Bank opened a new outlet in Kigali in the building called “Chez Rubangura”. It is intended to relocate the Roundabout Branch, since the building where it is currently housed does not meet planning standards and is intended for demolition. Tentatively, this new site serves as a local relay to the Central Branch during its renovation, till it returns to market standards.","Banking, Finance, Financial Services","Kigali, Butare, Rwanda",Cogebanque is a Rwandan multinational commercial bank.,401061,30000000,Active,01/01/1999,,"Financial Services, Lending and Investments",,,750,,,,,,6,"Information Technology, Management, Operations",27,,310,"6,214.83",-95.45%,"1,075",386.43%,5.4,-10.81%,70.65%,-40%,8308960,5815066,233.17%,34,0,,

We Hope & Wish This Message Finds You Well. Uassy Values Human, Especially, Women. The main question to be answered in the Republic is: What does Justice mean, and how can it be realized in human society? The Greek word for ‘Just‘ has as many senses as the English ‘right.’ It can mean: observant of custom or of duty, righteous; fair, honest; legally right, lawful; what is due to or from a person, deserts, rights; what one ought to do. Thus it covers the whole field of the individual’s conduct in so far as it affects others-all that they have a ‘right’ to expect from him or he has a right to expect from them, whatever is right as opposed to wrong. A proverbial saying declared that justice is the sum of all virtue. The Republic of Plato – Translated with Introduction and Notes by Francis Macdonald Comford, Oxford University Press, Book I, p. 1. The Mission Of Uassy, Is Making Quality Garments Accessible With Imagination, Innovation, And Originality. The Philosophy Of Uassy; Producing A Value Is Only Possible With Equity / Equality, Diversity, And Inclusion For Well-Being Of Present Civilization Of The 21st Century. The Infrastructure Of Uassy Refers To The Thought Of Plato. Plato’s Teacher, Socrates; And Plato’s Student, Aristotle; as well as, Protagoras, Not Only Laying The Foundation Of Art, Science, And Philosophy With Their Unique Thoughts But Also Have Built The Infrastructure, And Shared With That Century, As Well As Transferred The Foundation, e.g., Ontology, Epistemology, And Methodology To The Next Generations. Understanding A Life Experience, e.g., Of A Human, Is A Physical Phenomenon. Beyond The Physical Phenomenon, Feeling The Life Experience With Empathy Is A Metaphysical Phenomenon. A Human Can Shape A Thought. Life Comes Human With A Choice According To An Individual’s Experience Gained From A Knowledge. The Knowledge Is Not ‘Just‘ A Simple Phenomenon. The Knowledge Equally Comes Human Without A Choice For Each Individual With The Gift Of Increasing The Level Of Individual’s Knowledge. The Choice Is The Individual’s Decision In Respond To A Particular Fact (Maximus: The Fact Should Be Considered As Plural, i.e., ‘Facts’ Because The Facts Are Continuous For Human) That Determines Whether The Individual Passes The Exam For Earning The Gift Of The Universal Core For Accessing The Next Level Of The Knowledge. Meanwhile, The Determination Is The Consequences Of The Individual’s Decision That Comes From The Transformation Of A Metaphysical Phenomenon Into A Physical Phenomenon (i.e., Material, World, World-li-ness). A Choice Comes With The Choices. The Matter For The Choice Is Related To ‘Negative’ Or ‘Positive’ Response To A Fact. The Matter For The Choices Are Related To The Facts, And The Terms For Each Fact Is Interchangeable. For Example, ‘A Table’, As A Term, Can Be Defined As ‘Meeting Table’, That Allows People To Make A Meeting, And Can Also Be Defined As ‘Studying Table’, That Allows People To Study.
